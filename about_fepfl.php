        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>FEPFL Marriage Academy is an institution established to build human maturity through the knowledge of human emotions as a complete peace movement in marriages and families. “ # World Peace begins in your marriage.”</p>
        <p>It is building peace that is rooted in human emotional knowledge since human ignorance of emotions is unpardonable and the consequence is gradual death.</p>
        <p>We can only have a healthy and joyful world if all human beings are taken control of human emotions and the challenges of crises and violence in the world is the manifestations of human emotional identity crises in society.</< /p>
        <p>FEPFL Marriage Academy as an institution provides opportunities for those who aspire to improve their emotional health and build inner peace in self, marriage, community, and build systems for a culture of peace in societies and the World at large. </p>
        <p>The only way to promote peace and reduce violence in the world is through the knowledge of human emotions and this enhances attitudes of human maturity as the result of the human ability to control self-emotions.</p>
        <p>We all are victims of our emotions because we lack the capacities to control self-emotions due to our human ignorance of our inner-self.</p>
        <p>Human true success is measured in the individual emotional peace in connection to that success. Human success is easy with the knowledge of the inner-self, as all crimes and atrocities are committed to escape failures. We often struggled so hard to succeed and die gradually in the torments of human emotions and sometimes we lie to win the cases of life but we will soon be convicted to death by our human conscience.</p>
        <p>We say congratulations to you for taking bold steps to learn yourself and to be the best you are created, and it is only achievable through the best knowledge of life in your own self-emotional identities and with the greatest rewards of long life and true success. </p>
        <p>To change the negative narratives of all human domestic violence, knowledge is the answer not gender blames. Don’t die avoidable death for ignorance, your emotional peace is your marital peace, choose life by choosing knowledge of your emotions. The human challenge in marriage is that we refused to accept crisis and misunderstanding as normal and as part of the reasons for marriage. </p>
        <p>You are the only expert on all your emotional issues and your emotional healing can only be achieved by your commitment to knowing yourself. </p>
        <p>We welcome you to the journey into self and it is always interesting and amusing moments in life.</p>
        <p># Know yourself and make progress.</p>
